**todo: rewrite description**

A while ago I told a friend I would write up a tutorial on how I set up WireGuard and port forwarding through it. [Now that I have a personal website]({{< ref "/blog/good-enough" >}}) I actually have the motivation to do it! :)

I'm going to assume you already know what [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) and [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) are. You _should_ read a little bit about [firewalld](https://firewalld.org) if you haven't ever used it before but I won't judge you if you don't. Fair warning, I am _not_ a networking expert, I just managed to figure enough stuff out to do what I wanted to. My contact info is at the bottom of the home page if you want to give feedback; I'll make sure it ends up here!

**todo: finish everything else lol**

## Set up firewalld

## Set up WireGuard

## Set up WireGuard _again_

## Connect the dots

# Now

This is my ["now page"](https://nownownow.com/about) as of the end of 2024. If you want to know "what I'm up to these days" then you're at the right place.

## Work

I'm still working as a software developer at Rockwell Automation near Cleveland, OH, USA. To jog your memory, it's the same place where I interned at in college and also the same place where my dad works. I probably can't talk too much about it but I get to spend all day working with [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org) and some interesting network protocols which is fun.

## Personal

I've been living on my own for about a year now and it's been nice! The place I got is a little too big but oh well. :) Probably going to stick around for at least another year before moving somewhere more interesting.

These days I read, game, and learn random stuff in my free time - you know, the usual - no software side projects at the moment though. Lately I've been optimizing [dieting]({{< relref "/sandbox/diet-v1.md" >}}) and working out.

## What about you?

What are _you_ up to these days? Even if we haven't talked in a while I'd still love to hear from you! My contact info is at the bottom of the home page. :)

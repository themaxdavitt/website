# Now

This is my ["now page"](https://nownownow.com/about) as of early 2024. If you want to know "what I'm up to these days" then you're at the right place.

## Work

I'm currently working as a software developer at a company called Rockwell Automation near Cleveland, OH, USA. To jog your memory, it's the same place where I interned at in college and also the same place where my dad works. I probably can't talk too much about it but I get to spend all day working with [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org) and some interesting network protocols which is fun.

## Personal

Recently I moved out of my parents' place to a townhome in a little city north of Akron, OH. It's nice but I'm definitely still figuring out this whole "living on my own" thing! I also still wanna see what living downtown is like someday.

Lately in my free time I've just been gaming and wasting hours scrolling on my phone (I should try to get an ADHD test). When I was younger programming was my main hobby but now that I do it for work it's harder to motivate myself to do it for personal projects; I want to pick it back up though!

## What about you?

What are _you_ up to these days? Even if we haven't talked in a while I'd still love to hear from you! My contact info is at the bottom of the home page. :)

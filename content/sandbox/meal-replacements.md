| [Soylent Complete Meal](https://soylent.com/collections/meal-replacements) | [Creamy Chocolate](https://soylent.com/products/powder-cacao) (version unknown) | Haven't had in many years, but I remember it being good | Recommended, but hard to buy these days AFAICT |
| | [Original](https://soylent.com/products/powder-original) (v1.9?) | | |
| [Huel Black Edition](https://huel.com/products/huel-black-edition) | Chocolate v1.1 | Good, [Ovaltine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovaltine)-like I guess? | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Vanilla v1.1 | Painfully bland, adding cinnamon didn't help enough | Don't recommend |
| | Banana v1.1 | Okay, actually tastes like banana | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Strawberry Shortcake v1.1 | Okay, but kinda weird, doesn't taste like the name to me | Others may like it |
| | Cookies & Cream v1.1 | Good, doesn't taste like the name but it really grew on me | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Salted Caramel v1.1 | Only tried once but it tasted off, maybe too salty? | Others may like it |
| | Cinnamon Roll v1.1 | Not enough of an improvement over vanilla for me | Others may like it |
| [Jimmy Joy Plenny Shake](https://us.jimmyjoy.com/products/plenny-shake) | Vanilla v3.0 | Tastes like a vanilla-y milk..? Not what I was expecting | Others may like it |
| | Lemon Pie v3.0 | A hint of lemon and... I don't know what else. Hard to get through. | Don't recommend |
| | Pistachio v3.0 | Smells heavenly but has very little taste | Don't recommend |
| | Wild Berries v3.0 | Scent and (mild) taste kinda reminded me of fruit [Pop-Tarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts) | Recommended |
| [Hol Food Complete Nutrition](https://holfood.com/collections/meal-replacement) | [Rich Chocolate](https://holfood.com/collections/meal-replacement/products/hol-food-original) | | |

## Additional notes
- For average protein servings (e.g. ~20g per 400kcal), I usually mix in unflavored protein powder, which may skew my taste ratings
- FYI, Huel is much thicker than Soylent and Jimmy Joy
- Will probably swap Jimmy Joy Plenny Shake v3.0 reviews for Plenny Shake Active v3.1 reviews someday

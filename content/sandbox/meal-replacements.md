| [Soylent Complete Meal](https://soylent.com/collections/meal-replacements) | [Creamy Chocolate](https://soylent.com/products/powder-cacao) (version unknown) | Haven't had in many years, but I remember it being good | Recommended, but hard to buy these days AFAICT |
| | [Original](https://soylent.com/products/powder-original) (v1.9) | | |
| [Huel Black Edition](https://huel.com/products/huel-black-edition) | Chocolate v1.1 | Good, [Ovaltine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovaltine)-like I guess? [^huel-ice] | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Vanilla v1.1 | Painfully bland, adding cinnamon didn't help enough [^huel-ice] | Don't recommend |
| | Banana v1.1 | Good, actually tastes like banana | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Strawberry Shortcake v1.1 | Okay, but kinda weird, doesn't taste like the name to me | Others may like it |
| | Cookies & Cream v1.1 | Good, doesn't taste like the name but it really grew on me | Recommended, is in my rotation |
| | Salted Caramel v1.1 | Only tried once but it tasted off, maybe too salty? | Others may like it |
| | Cinnamon Roll v1.1 | Not enough of an improvement over vanilla for me | Others may like it |
| [Jimmy Joy Plenny Shake](https://us.jimmyjoy.com/products/plenny-shake) | Vanilla v3.0 | Tastes like a vanilla-y milk..? Not what I was expecting | Others may like it [^oatmilk] |
| | Lemon Pie v3.0 | A hint of lemon and... I don't know what else; you need to give it some time  | Others may like it [^oatmilk] [^lemon-pistachio] |
| | Pistachio v3.0 | Smells heavenly but has very little taste | Others may like it [^oatmilk] [^lemon-pistachio] |
| | Wild Berries v3.0 | Scent and (mild) taste kinda reminded me of fruit [Pop-Tarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts) | Recommended |

- For average protein servings (e.g. ~20g per 400kcal), I usually mix in unflavored protein powder, which may skew my taste ratings

## Huel

- Much thicker and gritter than other meal replacements; mixing in milk may help, but you'll get used to it after a while anyways

## Jimmy Joy

- Does not tolerate replacing water with ice (some of the drink will freeze!), you will need to chill it in the fridge
- May swap Jimmy Joy Plenny Shake v3.0 reviews for Plenny Shake Active v3.1 reviews someday

[^lemon-pistachio]: I like mixing Lemon Pie v3.0 and Pistachio v3.0, it's better than either standalone.

[^oatmilk]: Tastes better mixing out 6oz of the water for milk (I use Chobani Oatmilk Extra Creamy).

[^huel-ice]: Some Huel flavors really need to be cold to be enjoyed. I would recommend replacing some of the water with ice (e.g. 6oz).

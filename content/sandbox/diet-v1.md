I've been overweight for the vast majority of my life and this is my first real attempt at rectifying that. I don't have a specific end goal in mind - I was mainly interested in just establishing being thoughtful about what I eat as a habit - but, in combination with my fitness "journey", I'd like to get to around 15% body fat (my scale said I was at ~40% when I started). I know, that's pretty ambitious, but I think I can do it. :)

My diet is kinda weird; basically, for ~80% of my meals, I use [meal replacements]({{< relref "meal-replacements" >}}). They're nutritionally complete so I can be sure that it's giving me all the stuff I need to survive (and thrive, in comparison to my previous mostly fast food diet (blame depression)). I live in the U.S.A., where every food is like 2x the amount of calories you think it is, so this is a good way to make sure I'm staying within my caloric budget. They also make calorie counting really convenient; most meal replacement servings are ~400kcal, which my budget is a multiple of, and after I put their nutritional info into my diet tracking app it just takes a few taps to log another serving.

My daily caloric budget is 1600kcal. This is low, but IIRC the deficit created is within the 0.5 - 1.0% of bodyweight loss that's deemed safe, so I'm not concerned (for reference, my expenditure is ~2450 calories). Surprisingly, I don't ever feel hungry when eating the meal replacements. I think it's because they're typically high in fiber (relatively speaking; the average American diet is really bad), though I also consume a lot of protein (I aim for ~1.6g per kg of bodyweight, which is hard), which I think helps..? Funnily enough I only ever feel hungry when I need to skip meal replacement meals to fit in "real" meals with family and friends (in which case I usually feel hungry before AND after!).

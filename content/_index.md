# Hello world!

I'm Max Davitt. I'm 22 years old, use he/him pronouns, and live near Cleveland, OH, USA. I've been interested in software development for a large chunk of my life and it's what keeps me employed. Outside of that I also enjoy learning about business, journalism, and media production.

This is my little website. It's [open-source](https://github.com/themaxdavitt/website) and built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Bear Blog](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/) theme. The "Home" page is what you're currently reading, the "Now" page is basically "what I'm up to these days", and the "Blog" is where I put all the _stuff_ that I talk about here. :)

Blog posts are tagged to make them easier to sift through. I don't really know what I want the tag taxonomy to look like but I'll keep things backwards compatible at least. RSS feeds are also available for both the full blog and filtered by tag. If your feed reader doesn't auto-detect them you should be able to get the feed URL by throwing `index.xml` at the end of the page's URL. 

If you'd like to contact me, my email address is `my first name`&nbsp;@&nbsp;`my last name`&nbsp;.&nbsp;me (if you're confused look at the URL of this website). I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themaxdavitt) and <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@themaxdavitt">Mastodon</a>, though I can't promise I'll post often on either. Thanks for checking out my website!
